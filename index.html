                        <p class="p">Hasbro and Lionsgate have signed Zoe Saldana for the voice cast of the animated “My Little Pony:
                            The Movie,” Variety has learned exclusively. Previously announced voice cast members include
                            Sia, Liev Schreiber, Taye Diggs, Emily Blunt, Kristin Chenoweth, Uzo Aduba, and Michael Pena.
                            Lionsgate is releasing “My Little Pony” on Oct. 6, 2017. Jayson Thiessen is directing from a
                            screenplay by Meghan McCarthy, writer and producer of the “My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic”
                            animated series.</p>

                        <p class="p">While Martin Scorsese always seems to have a busy schedule, it might have opened up slightly given
                            the recent revelation that he bailed on that Frank Sinatra biopic. The director’s next picture
                            is expected to be the hitman tale “The Irishman,” which will reteam him with his longtime friend
                            Robert De Niro, but according to Jamie Foxx, Scorsese is still going to make a Mike Tyson biopic.</p>

                        <p class="p">Rogue One was quite awesome, and quite different from the movies that came before. It was frightening,
                            tense, very dark, VERY dirty (literally: maybe Mon Mothma was the only character without a layer
                            of filth make-upped onto her face. And she looked so much like Mothma from ROTJ!) Some differences
                            were somewhat striking, but overall it absolutely felt like a Star Wars movie should feel.

                        <p class="p">Felicity Rose Hadley Jones is an English actress. Jones was born in Birmingham, West Midlands, and
                            grew up in Bournville. Her parents met while working at the Wolverhampton Express and Star. Her
                            father was a journalist while her mother was in advertising. They divorced when she was three,
                            and she was brought up with her brother by her mother alone. Despite this, she has said that
                            her family is "extremely close." Her uncle is actor Michael Hadley. <br>
